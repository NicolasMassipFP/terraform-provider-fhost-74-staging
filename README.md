## Which provider version to use ?

ngfw_smc_74 rely on SMC Version 7.4 and SMC API Version 7.4.
Using it with other version then 7.4 is out of the scope.

Provider is not available currently for versionn prior to 7.4.

## Requirements

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) 0.12.x +
- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) 1.21.x (to build the provider plugin)
- The provider can cover SMC >= 7.3.X versions, the configuration of all parameters should be based on the relevant SMC documentation. For SMC, the support on this provider is deprecated, please use [SMC Terraform provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/smcdev/smc/latest) instead.

## Building the Provider

## Using the Provider

Internal version for testing purpose only.

## Developing the Provider

This provider is managed by Forcepoint R&D internally. The public repositoryis updated by Forcepoint when releasing new SMC Version or on provider update.

You can still compile locally the provider using ``make build`` command.
The compilation rely on docker container that will be retrieved and generate locally.

For your information, the provider implementation is generated from the Open API specification of SMC API.
